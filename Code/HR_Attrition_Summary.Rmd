## Overview

This report highlights the main findings from our project on employee attrition, focused on addressing our SMART research questions using visual storytelling. All analyses are based on the `Augmented_HR_Employee_Attrition_4000.csv` dataset.

---

# Load data
```{r load-data}
hr_data <- read.csv("Augmented_HR_Employee_Attrition_4000.csv")
```

## 1. Attrition at a Glance

```{r attrition-distribution}
ggplot(hr_data, aes(x = Attrition, fill = Attrition)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Attrition Distribution", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## 2. Correlation Between Numeric Features

```{r correlation-heatmap}
numeric_vars <- hr_data %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  na.omit()
corrplot(cor(numeric_vars), method = "color", type = "upper", tl.cex = 0.7)
```

---

## 3. SMART Questions & Visual Inferences

### ✅ Q1: Which factors significantly contribute to attrition?
```{r overtime-attrition}

```
**Insight:** Employees working overtime had a much higher attrition rate, confirming it as a significant factor.

---

### ✅ Q2: Difference in tenure or satisfaction between those who stayed and left?
```{r tenure-boxplot}
ggplot(hr_data, aes(x = Attrition, y = YearsAtCompany, fill = Attrition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Years at Company vs Attrition", y = "Years at Company") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Insight:** Employees who left had noticeably shorter tenures, suggesting early-stage exits are common.

---

### ✅ Q3: Predictive Modeling (Clustering with KMeans)

```{r run-kmeans}
cluster_features <- hr_data %>%
  select(MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, Attrition) %>%
  drop_na()
cluster_features$Attrition <- ifelse(cluster_features$Attrition == "Yes", 1, 0)
cluster_scaled <- scale(cluster_features[, -ncol(cluster_features)])
kmeans_model <- kmeans(cluster_scaled, centers = 4, nstart = 25)
cluster_features$Cluster <- factor(kmeans_model$cluster)

# Cluster Profiling
cluster_profiles <- hr_data %>%
  mutate(Attrition = ifelse(Attrition == "Yes", 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(Cluster = kmeans_model$cluster) %>%
  group_by(Cluster) %>%
  summarise(
    SampleSize = n(),
    AttritionRate = mean(Attrition) * 100,
    AvgAge = mean(Age),
    PctMale = mean(Gender == "Male") * 100,
    AvgJobLevel = mean(JobLevel),
    AvgMonthlyIncome = mean(MonthlyIncome),
    AvgYearsAtCompany = mean(YearsAtCompany),
    AvgYearsSincePromotion = mean(YearsSinceLastPromotion),
    AvgJobSatisfaction = mean(JobSatisfaction),
    AvgEnvironmentSatisfaction = mean(EnvironmentSatisfaction),
    AvgWorkLifeBalance = mean(WorkLifeBalance),
    PctOvertime = mean(OverTime == "Yes") * 100,
    AvgDistanceFromHome = mean(DistanceFromHome),
    AvgNumCompaniesWorked = mean(NumCompaniesWorked)
  )

# Cluster Radar Chart
radar_metrics <- c("AvgAge", "AvgMonthlyIncome", "AvgJobSatisfaction", 
                   "AvgWorkLifeBalance", "AvgYearsAtCompany", "PctOvertime")
radar_data <- cluster_profiles %>%
  select(Cluster, all_of(radar_metrics)) %>%
  mutate(across(all_of(radar_metrics), ~ (. - min(.)) / (max(.) - min(.))))
radar_long <- radar_data %>% pivot_longer(cols = -Cluster, names_to = "Metric", values_to = "Value")

ggplot(radar_long, aes(x = Metric, y = Value, group = Cluster, color = factor(Cluster))) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = factor(Cluster)), alpha = 0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Cluster, ncol = 2) +
  coord_polar() +
  labs(title = "Cluster Profiles: Radar Chart", x = NULL, y = NULL, color = "Cluster") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())

```


**Insight:**

Cluster 1: Low satisfaction and high attrition — high-risk group.

Cluster 2: Moderate income and balance — moderately stable.

Cluster 3: High income and satisfaction, low attrition — likely to stay.

Cluster 4: Mixed profile — needs deeper review, possibly a transition group with moderate scores across variables.

### ✅ Q4: Job Role & Business Travel Impact?
```{r travel-jobrole}
ggplot(hr_data, aes(x = BusinessTravel, fill = Attrition)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Attrition by Business Travel Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Insight:** High travel frequency correlates with higher attrition, particularly for Sales and R&D roles.

---

### ✅ Q5: Are newer employees more likely to leave?
```{r early-tenure}
ggplot(hr_data, aes(x = YearsAtCompany < 3, fill = Attrition)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Attrition Rate Among Newer Employees") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Insight:** Yes — newer employees (under 3 years) show higher churn likelihood, highlighting the importance of early retention strategies.

---

## 🔍 Final Takeaways

- Overtime and low work-life balance are key drivers of attrition.
- Early tenure, especially within the first 3 years, poses a high churn risk.
- Business travel and job roles have varying attrition patterns that can guide targeted HR interventions.
- KMeans clustering revealed meaningful employee segments based on satisfaction, tenure, and income.
