A Statistical and Predictive Analysis of HR Attrition Patterns
HR Insight Logo

üìä Overview
This repository presents a detailed statistical and machine learning-driven analysis of employee turnover. The goal is to understand the key drivers behind HR attrition and build predictive models to identify at-risk employees before they leave the organization.

üë• Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes a cleaned HR dataset containing demographic and organizational attributes of employees. Key data files include:

employee_attrition.csv: Main dataset with employee-level information

turnover_trends.csv: Historical monthly turnover data

satisfaction_scores.csv: Employee satisfaction across various parameters

promotion_salary.csv: Records of promotions and compensation changes

job_roles_breakdown.csv: Attrition trends across different job roles and departments

exit_reason_tags.csv: Annotated reasons for employee exits

üîß Dependencies
